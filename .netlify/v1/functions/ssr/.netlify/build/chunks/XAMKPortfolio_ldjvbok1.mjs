It holds all the same projects as this portfolio.\n\n### Progress\n\nThe portfolio came to be very easily. I started working on it during some evening and didn't stop until I had everything that I needed for it.\n\n### Problems\n\nDidn't really encounter any problems. I stayed within my repertoire of skills and was done with the portfolio in no time. I have since been updating it regularily.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIt was a fun and small project that we had to do for a course. I was pleased with it and didn't really see a need to go over-board with it.\n\n<style>\n  .link-to-portfolio{\n    font-size: 1.7rem;\n    color: var(--accent-purple-3);\n  }\n\n  @media (max-width: 719px){\n    .link-to-portfolio{\n      font-size: 1.1rem;\n    }\n  }\n</style>";
