I have yet to fix this part.\n        </p>\n        <div class=\"image-container\">\n            <img src=\"/public/images/Password_generator.jpg\" alt=\"img of password generator\">\n            <img src=\"/public/images/Password_generator_1.png\" alt=\"filled\">\n        </div>\n        <p>\n            I got the idea for this password generator as I was working on the\n            Python course provided Helsinki University. I wanted to make it into\n            an app, so I did. I used tKinter library from python for the UI\n            and made it look as simple and easy-to-use as possible.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Problems</h4>\n        <p>\n            I did not remember how to use tKinter as it \n            had been over a year since I last worked on it.\n            I watched a part of the tKinter tutorial provided\n            by FreeCodeCamp and I was already on my way. \n            I also had problems creating the file for the saved passwords,\n            but I am going to fix this issue once I find out how.\n        </p>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/AstRoXAMK/Pyhton-password-generator/tree/main\" class=\"link-text\">\n            Link to source code\n        </a>\n    </div>\n    <br>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"projects-right\">\n    <div class=\"project-item\" id=\"Tetris\">\n      <h4>Tetris with <span>PyGame</span></h4>\n      <p class=\"status\">Status: <span class=\"status-working\">Working on</span></>\n      <p>\n          A personal game version of tetris. I have plans to use this game file for future ML/AI projects\n          of creating bots that can continuesly get better as the game continues.\n      </p>\n      <div class=\"image-container\">\n          <p>\n              ---- Pictures to come ----\n          </p>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n          I got the Idea from watchin PyGame tutorials and I also saw a deep learning video of\n          bots for the game \"Jump King\". The video creator made his own version of Jump King in JavaScript\n          so I am hoping to be able to do the same for Tetris.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Problems</h4>\n      <p>\n          I have made just the base game with a tutorial, bu the bots are something that I have yet to work on.\n      </p>\n      <a href=\"#\" class=\"link-text\" target=\"_blank\">\n          Link to source code\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<style>\n  .projects-container{\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n    gap: 3rem;\n  }\n\n  .project-item{\n    border: 5px solid var(--accent-cyan-2);\n    border-radius: 50px;\n    padding: 0 1rem 2rem 1rem;\n    background-color: var(--accent-gray);\n  }\n\n  .status{\n    font-size: 1.2rem;\n    margin: 1rem 0;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n\n  .status-completed{\n    color: var(--accent-code);\n  }\n\n  .status-working{\n    color: var(--accent-working);\n  }\n\n  .status-dropped{\n    color: var(--accent-dropped);\n  }\n\n  .project-item ul{\n    margin: 1rem 0;\n  }\n\n  .image-container{\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    gap: 1rem;\n    margin: 1rem 0;\n  }\n\n  .link-text{\n    text-transform: uppercase;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    color: var(--accent-purple-3);\n    text-decoration: none;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n    margin: 1rem 0 0 0;\n  }\n\n  .link-text:hover{\n    color: var(--accent-purple-2);\n  }\n\n  @media (max-width: 719px){\n    .projects-container{\n      grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n    }\n\n    .link-text{\n      font-size: 1rem;\n    }\n  }\n\n</style>";
