I was working on Helsinki University MOOC-course \"Data Analysis with Python\", which I will work on along side this book. I found this book by sheer coincidence\n\nThis book was created by 5 different professors from 3 different universities in the USA. Most notably 3 professors from Stamford University, Prof. Trevor Hastie, Prof. Rob Tibshirani and Prof. Jonathan Taylor all of whom are professors of Statistics. Other co-authors are Prof. Gareth James of Emory University, Goizueta Business School and Prof. Daniela Witten of the University of Washington also professor of Statistics.\n\n### Description\n\n\"As the scale and scope of data collection continue to increase across virtually all fields, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data. An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides a broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. This book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use contemporary tools for data analysis.\n\nThe first edition of this book, with applications in R (ISLR), was released in 2013. A 2nd Edition of ISLR was published in 2021. It has been translated into Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Russian, and Vietnamese. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023.\"\n\n### Progress\n\n<div class=\"table-of-contents\">\n  <div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 1 - <span>Introduction</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 3 - <span>Resampling methods</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 5 - <span>Support Vector Machines</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>  \n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 7 - <span>Multiple Testing</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 9 - <span>Classification</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 11 - <span>Tree-Based Methods</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 13 - <span>Unsupervised learning</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 2 - <span>Linear Regression</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 4 - <span>Moving Beyond Liearity</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 6 - <span>Survival Analysis and Censored Data</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 8 - <span>Statistical Learning</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 10 - <span>Linear Model Selection and Regularization</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <p class=\"title\">\n        Chapter 12 - <span>Deep Learning</span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"text\">\n        Text here\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<style>\n  .link-to-book {\n    text-transform: uppercase;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    color: var(--accent-purple-3);\n    text-decoration: none;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n  }\n\n  .link-to-book:hover{\n    color: var(--accent-purple-2);\n  }\n  \n  .table-of-contents{\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n  }\n\n  .table-of-contents span{\n    color: var(--accent-cyan-3);\n  }\n\n  .table-of-contents .title{\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n  }\n\n  .table-of-contents .text{\n    margin-bottom: 1rem;\n  }\n  \n  @media (max-width: 719px){\n    .table-of-contents{\n      grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n    }\n\n    .table-of-contents .title{\n      font-size: 1.2rem;\n    }\n  }\n</style>\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Note";
